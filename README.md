## Concept of mutual friendship

A mutual friend is an individual who has established a friendship with two
people. When those two people meet, they learn that they share the same friend;
that friend they have in common is their mutual friend. If the two people become
friends, a circle of friendship develops between the mutual friend and the other
individuals - from [oel](https://oureverydaylife.com/mutual-friend-mean-10031289.html#:~:text=A%20mutual%20friend%20is%20an,common%20is%20their%20mutual%20friend.&text=Mutual%20friendships%20are%20commonplace%20in,other%20by%20a%20mutual%20friend.)
